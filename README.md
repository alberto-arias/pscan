A simple tool to train visual scanning of chess positions

## Goal
As a proxy for improving your evaluation skills, this tool aims at improving your awareness to a number of relevant features of a chess position. Indirectly, itÂ´s been an opportunity for me to become familiar with python-chess.

## How to
Set a position in the board and force yourself to enumerate its relevant features, trying to match those identified by the tool.
